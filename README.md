java_examples
code example to create a task list with deadlines. This implementation uses generics to ensure flexibility and type safety. We have defined a Task class and a TaskList class that can add, update, and modify tasks.

This code defines:
- A Task class with a generic type T for the task description and a LocalDate for the deadline.
- A TaskList class to manage a list of tasks, with methods to add, update, and modify tasks.
- An example usage in the main method to demonstrate adding, updating, and modifying tasks.
